# Deploying matomo

By default Matomo will not run and the local build will not report feedback

To report to Matomo you must add the following environment variables:

    export ENABLE_MATOMO=true
    export MATOMO_SITE_ID= ...
    export MATOMO_IP= ...
    export MATOMO_URL= ...

The site_id, ip and url will depend on what you have configured your matomo instance is. (For worth details see keybase)

You will then need to do a gatsby build and serve ( Not an npm run local! )
